<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to my landing page. I am a mechanical engineering master's student at Lamar University, where I'm specializing in mechanical and thermal design.
    I am currently looking for a full-time engineering position, but I am also exploring freelance work in the areas of music and web development. On this site you
    will soon find everything under the sun that I have been working on, as well as my resume and contact information, among other easter eggs... This site was crafted in the old style, using 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also just started working on it, so more is coming soon.
